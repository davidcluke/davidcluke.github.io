<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
I have had a lengthy and broad career in technology over the past 20+ years. I started as a programmer and rapidly moved into many different roles in many different types and sizes of companies. From the very large to the 1-man shop and everything in between. One common theme throughout all of my experiences has been a love and a passion for design and user interfaces, how something looks and how a user interacts with it. Very early on I learned that what something looks like can make or break its' success regardless of the technology or the solution behind it.
